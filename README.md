# HRLFD â€“ Hybrid Reinforcement Learning for Fraud Detection  

This repository contains a research project exploring how **reinforcement learning (RL)** can be combined with traditional **machine learning classifiers** to improve fraud detection in highly imbalanced datasets.  

## âš¡ Features
- **Q-Learning agent** trained to maximize fraud detection performance  
- **Decision tree ensemble** for candidate filtering  
- **Custom reward function** designed to penalize false negatives heavily  
- **SMOTE resampling** for balancing rare fraud cases  
- **Evaluation metrics** including precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC AUC  

## ðŸ“¦ Tech Stack
- **Python** â†’ Core implementation  
- **scikit-learn** â†’ Decision trees, evaluation metrics  
- **imbalanced-learn** â†’ SMOTE resampling  
- **NumPy / Pandas** â†’ Data manipulation  
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn** â†’ Visualization
